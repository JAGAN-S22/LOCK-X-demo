# LOCK-X-demo
**LOCK-X** is a disaster-response screen-locking system that secures devices when a crisis is detected in the area. It uses the deviceâ€™s unique ID to lock the screen, preventing shutdown, display changes, or unauthorized access. Ideal for emergency systems, it ensures critical devices remain active and tamper-proof during disasters.
