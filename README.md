# 🔒 LOCK-X

**LOCK-X** is a disaster-response screen-locking system that automatically secures devices when a disaster is detected in the area. It uses the device’s unique identification number (such as IMEI or serial ID) to lock the screen, preventing shutdown, display changes, or unauthorized access. LOCK-X ensures that critical devices stay locked and operational during emergencies.
